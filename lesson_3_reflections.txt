When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I would use a remote repository if I'm working on a project in different computers
    or if there is a collaboration in the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I would want to pull changes manually rather tan having Git do it automatically
    because I may have some commits in my staging area that I would need to push before.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is two create a replica of a remote copy of a repository in your
    Github account. Clones is two create a copy of a repository from a remote
    repository to local, or from local to local. Branch is to create a new
    branch that points to a commit in your repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can work with the latest version of the repository offline with the
    recent changes made.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I could use a web app like Floobits where two people can collaborate live
    and test the code, it would be easier since we would share the same files
    and all the changes will reflect automatically on mine. The cons is that,
    to work, you need to be online while using it.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    You want to make changes in a separate branch when you want to add a new
    feature or create versions of the project that may not be working properly.
    Making changes in the main branch will not create conflicts but may end up
    in a version that doesn't work.
