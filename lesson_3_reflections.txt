When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I would use a remote repository if I'm working on a project in different computers
    or if there is a collaboration in the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I would want to pull changes manually rather tan having Git do it automatically
    because I may have some commits in my staging area that I would need to push before.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is two create a replica of a remote copy of a repository in your
    Github account. Clones is two create a copy of a repository from a remote
    repository to local, or from local to local. Branch is to create a new
    branch that points to a commit in your repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
